I reallly just needed an excuse to get my hands dirty with MAchine learning, Flask and, Containerization, Jenkins continuous development and to make fun
of my friend Adam. So here we are hehe.

## How to Run
 ``` pip install requirements.txt ```
 and then 
 ``` flask run ```
 then visit https://localhost/5000
 
 
 You can perform  RESTFUL predictions at the /predict path. So
 ``` $ curl -F "image=@potato.jpg" http://localhost:5000/predict ```
 
 Several Credits are due here - Credit to the codepen.io template i refactored, several stackOverflow comment threads AND several articles
